# Graph class implementation

The Digraph class (it's still being updated the day this was posted) is a class that have member functions for a graph construction, allowing to visualize
the graph with the Graphviz (.dot) support and useful to understand how a graph really works!

OBS: Install Graphviz before run the code

In ubuntu >> sudo apt-get graphviz
